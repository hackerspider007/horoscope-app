Steps to run the project locally

Step-1 Download the project as zip file


Step-2 Extract the folders from the zip file.


Step-3 Open the project in your favourite code editor. I have used VS Code.


Step-4 Intalling all the dependencies
        In the terminal type the following commands one by one
        npm install
        
        this will download node_modules folder
        
        
        npm install nodemon
        
        this command will install nodemon
        
        
        npm install express
        
        this command will install express
        
        
        npm install ejs
        
        this command will install ejs
        
        Now , we are done with installing dependencies.
        
        
  Step-5   Now, type this command to start the server locally:--
            npm start
            
            
  Step-6   Open your favourite browser and type 
            localhost:3000
            
           and hit enter.
           Now you are all set.
